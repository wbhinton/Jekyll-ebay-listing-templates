    <h4><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt"></span> Description</h4>
    <p>This Onkyo SACD plays CDs and SACDs, and sounds great. I've been the only owner and <b>I've been very happy with it, with one exception</b>. At some point the eject functionality started to get spotty. So while disks load and play fine, <mark>sometimes when you try to eject the disk, it will not eject</mark>. The workaround is to open the unit (via screws on the bottom) and manually remove the disk, but obviously this is not ideal. I don't want to deal with getting it repaired, but it could be a small thing that someone with some skills may be able to fix it for free. The top has a some scratches that you can see in the photos, but nothing major, and none on the front. Remote, power cord and original packaging included.</p>
<p>Includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Onkyo C-S5VL player</li>
    <li>Onkyo C-S5VL remote</li>
    <li>Power cord</li>
    <li>Original packaging</li>
</ul>
<p>Again <b>unit functions and plays fine,</b> <mark>however the eject functionality will intermittently fail to work.</mark> See description.</p>
