Are those my clocks I hear? So tell me, future boy, who's president of the United States in 1985? That's a Florence Nightingale effect. It happens in hospitals when nurses fall in love with their patients. Go to it, kid. I do understand. If I know too much about my own future I could endanger my own existence, just as you endangered yours. What did your mother ever see in that kid?

Unfortunately no, it requires something with a little more kick, plutonium. You too. Oh, thank you, thank you. Okay now, we run some industrial strength electrical cable from the top of the clocktower down to spreading it over the street between two lamp posts. Meanwhile, we out-fitted the vehicle with this big pole and hook which runs directly into the flux-capacitor. At the calculated moment, you start off from down the street driving toward the cable execrating to eighty-eight miles
per hour. According to the flyer, at !0:04 pm lightning will strike the clocktower sending one point twenty-one gigawatts into the flux-capacitor, sending you back to 1985. Alright now, watch this. You wind up the car and release it, I'll simulate the lightening. Ready, set, release. Huhh. Don't say a word. You too.

Well, I figured, what the hell. The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car why not do it with some style. Besides, the stainless, steel construction made the flux dispersal- look out. Pretty Mediocre photographic fakery, they cut off your brother's hair. Oh, great scott. You get the cable, I'll throw the rope down to you. My equipment, that reminds me, Marty, you better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility for overload.
